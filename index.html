    <p>Ooty is noted for a delightful scenic backdrop of nature. Set inside the Nilgiri hills, these blue mountains can almost make you forget the scorching heat of sun. It was nicknamed’ Snooty Ooty’ during the times when Ooty used to be the Summer Headquarters of British colonial government in Madras. The charm of the forests here are undeniably spectacular, stunning and romantic for trekking.  These hills sprawl between the green valleys and lakes. There are fine view points, tea plantations, falls, grasslands, pine and wattle lining the landscapes and above all the tranquil climate and the air can only leave a visitor refreshing and relaxed. Hence Ooty has been a loved shooting location for the film makers of South Indian film Industry during 80 s and 90s.</p>

    <p>A special blend of spices is used for the biryani. A type of short grain seeraga samba rice, called Parakkum Sittu and Kannivadi meat which comes from tender grass-fed goats makes the taste distinct. This rice, unlike basmati has no taste of its own, so it completely absorbs the flavours of the spices.</p>
